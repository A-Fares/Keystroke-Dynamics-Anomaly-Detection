# Keystroke-Dynamics-Anomaly-Detection
As cybersecurity attacks increase, the static  methods for anomaly detection are no longer enough for  protection. We proposed an algorithm for dynamic anomaly  detection based on keystroke patterns that are unique for  everyone, just like your fingerprint but digitally. Behavioral  biometrics also overcome the most important limitation of  physiological biometrics systems, as we can collect them without  the knowledge of the user, allowing for continuous  authentication. The user rhythm for 51 users with the fixed text  password (.tie5Roanl) typed in 8 sessions for 50 repetitions per  session. The proposed model Random Forrest achieve 94.09 %  for F1 for this study. However, we tested the work by our own  dataset which was collected and tested by typing the same  password to check the user authentication.
